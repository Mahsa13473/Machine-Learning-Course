The readme file should describe what you implemented for this problem and what each one of your code files does. It should also include the command to run your code. If you have any figures or tables to show, put them in your report for this assignment and mention them in your readme file.

â€¢ Write a Python function to be used at the end of training that generates HTML output show- ing each test image and its classification scores. You could produce an HTML table output for example.

(You can see the result for 4000 images in HTML.html)

I put maximum number of test images to 100(max_iter) You can change this number if you want to test on the whole test images. The output will be save in HTML.html

To run this code : python imagenet_finetune.py (you need a trained model to run this code. I trained network and saved as a model.pt) (the size was large so I do not upload that)

I also put a figure in my report.
